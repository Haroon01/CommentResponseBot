"Remember when Lady Gaga and Will Young both revealed they had previously suffered with post-traumatic stress disorder. To which Piers Morgan, fancying himself as a medical health professional, claimed Will has never suffered with PTSD, instead having what he calls - WNTS (whiny needy twerp syndrome) https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/869233083710681088"
"Remember when Piers branded Emma Watson a “feminist fraud” when she posed for a photo-shoot in Vanity Fair, in which she was photographed in a more revealing way than usual. https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/838769536375603200?lang=en"
"Remember when Piers genuinely thought he was making an excellent point by bringing up race in a conversation about gender identity? Announcing he's a ""black woman"". https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-1465965/Piers-Morgan-calls-black-woman-heated-gender-debate.html"
"Remember when Piers took the opportunity to calm criticism re Donald Trump's decision to appoint multiple known racists, including a chief strategist Steve Bannon who has been labelled a white nationalist and Jeff Sessions as attorney general (who joked that the one issue he took with the KKK was its drug use, who was denied appointment as a federal judge in 1986 for a slew of racist comments, including calling the work of the NAACP and ACLU ‘un-American.’ Someone who has also repeatedly spoken out against the federal Voting Rights Act), saying: “I don’t think he’s the next Hitler. I don’t think he’s appointing a bunch of Nazis in his cabinet. I think he’s a pragmatic business guy who played very hardball to get the Republication nomination.”"
"Remember Piers' ageist statements regarding the singer and pop icon Madonna, “She is becoming increasingly grotesque and embarrassing, to watch a woman in her late-50s cavorting around in fishnet stockings, falling over, swearing, shouting and behaving like a… you can fill in the blank. I find it absolutely toe-curling.”"
"Remember when Piers ripped into celebrities who speak openly about conditions such as depression. The presenter not only tried to promote the ""stiff upper lip"" approach to life but also urged people to ""man up"" – right in the middle of Mental Health Awareness Week."
